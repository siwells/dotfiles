# The following are environment variables that are required to get OMERO setup correctly on Debian or Ubuntu systems. Interpolate these VARS with whatever you already have set up in your .bashrc on the system that will OMERO.

# Ensure that JAVA is set up correctly
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun
export JRE_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun

# OMERO relies on ICE so get that set up
export ICE_HOME=/usr/share/Ice-3.3.1

# The default SQL server for OMERO is PostGres so we need that too
export POSTGRES_HOME=/usr/lib/postgresql/8.4

# Now let the system know where the omero server will reside
export OMERO_SERVER=/home/omero/OMERO.server

# Add bin folders for everything we just defined to your path
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$JRE_HOME/bin:$ICE_HOME:$POSTGRES_HOME/bin:$OMERO_SERVER/bin

# Need PYTHONPATH to be set for OMERO.scripts to work
export PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.6:$PYTHONPATH

# Also need library paths set for correct functionality
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/share/java:/usr/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/share/java:/usr/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
